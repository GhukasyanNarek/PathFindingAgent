# üöÄ **Path-Finding Agent**

## üìù **Description**

The **Path-Finding Agent** visualizes and evaluates various pathfinding algorithms on a grid. It offers real-time visualizations and metrics, making it a valuable tool for educational purposes, algorithm testing, and demonstrating search strategies.

The project implements algorithms such as:
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
- **DFS** (Depth-First Search)
- **A*** (A-star Search)
- **Greedy Best-First Search**

The tool includes features like step-by-step visualization, metric tracking (e.g., path cost, execution time), and the ability to save results in Excel files.

## üéÆ **Usage**

### Running the Project
To start the program, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Features

1. **Grid Visualization**:
   - Interactive grid where nodes are visualized as:
     - **Start (Green)**
     - **End (Light Cyan)**
     - **Barriers (Black)**
     - **Frontier, Not Explored(Green)**
     - **Explored (Red)**
     - **Path (Purple)**

2. **Algorithm Comparison**:
   - Run all algorithms on the same configuration to compare their performance.

3. **Metrics Export**:
   - Results are saved to `data.xlsx` with detailed metrics for each run.

## üïπÔ∏è **Modes of Operation**

The **Path-Finding Agent** provides three distinct modes of operation to test and visualize pathfinding algorithms effectively:

### 1. **Manual Mode**
   - In this mode, the user can manually configure the grid by:
     - Placing start and end points.
     - Adding barriers to simulate obstacles.
   - After setting up the grid, the user presses "Space", and the program visualizes the step-by-step execution of the chosen algorithm (should choose from the main.py loop)

### 2. **Automated Random Mode**
   - The grid is automatically generated with random configurations:
     - Randomly placed barriers.
     - Start and end points are selected randomly.
   - The user's preselected algorithm runs on the random grid, and the pathfinding process is visualized. Then, based on `num_tests` the iterations continue into the next one

### 3. **Automated Random Mode for All Algorithms**
   - A random grid is generated, and all implemented algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*, Greedy Best-First Search) are executed sequentially on the **same grid**.
   - This mode provides a side-by-side comparison of:
     - Execution time.
     - Steps taken.
     - Path length.
     - Expanded nodes.
    
       
   - Results for all algorithms are exported to an Excel file (`data.xlsx`) for further analysis.

---

Each mode is designed to offer flexibility for users, from manual control to fully automated testing and comparison. The **Automated Random Mode for All Algorithms** is particularly useful for analyzing and benchmarking algorithm performance on identical conditions.

## üì¶ **Sample Output**

The project tracks and visualizes the following metrics:
- Actual Path.
- Execution time (seconds).
- Number of steps.
- Manhattan Distance (the heuristic)
- Number of expanded nodes.
- Name of the Algorithm

Results are saved to `data.xlsx`. Here‚Äôs an example of how the metrics are logged:


| **Path**                   | **Execution Time** | **Steps** | **Manhattan Distance** | **Expanded Nodes** | **Algorithm** |
